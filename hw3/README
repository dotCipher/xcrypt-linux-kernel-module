============ XCrypt Cipher Tool ============
Author: Cody Moore

This program allows the user to either encrypt 
and/or decrypt any given file using algorithms 
provided in the Crypto API Library.

Please note, a password must be provided in 
the command line arguments for successful 
program execution.

========= Description ========= 

This program was made for the ease of access
of anyone who would like to invoke direct
system calls of any kernel-level algorithms
provided in the Crypto API Library.

This program consists of two main (2) parts:
	
	sys_xcrypt.c 
	
	&
	
	xcipher.c

The sys_xcrypt.c part consists of all the 
kernel level Crypto API Library calls, while
the xcipher.c part consists of all the 
user level code that that allows the user to
interact with the system calls.

Essentially it currently operates using the
system constant of PAGE_CACHE_SIZE to encrypt
and/or decrypt chunks of data at a time. 
The neat way that it saves kernel memory is 
by using temporary scatterlist structures
to encrypt and/or decrypt a buffer in-place.
This allows any person running the program to
save space on thier kernel (as opposed to 
have two buffers).

The key size of 16 bytes was selected based 
on the main algorithm that this tool uses:

	Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

using the method of 

	Cipher-block chaining (CBC)

(For more details, see References section)

Since the program will access any given files
data in chunks, there are occasions when the
amount of data accessed is smaller than the
PAGE_CACHE_SIZE.  In these cases, the XCrypt
Cipher Tool will either do one of two things
based on if the data being accessed needs to
be encrypted or decrypted.

Case 1: Data encryption -
	The program will pad the endd of the
	buffer with zeros.
	
Case 2: Data decryption -
	The program will decrypt normally, 
	however when the buffer is decrypted,
	the program will then remove all of
	the padded zeros from the plaintext
	buffer automatically.

========= Installation ========= 

Installation is easy, first place 
yourself inside the directory that both
'sys_xcrypt.c' and 'xcipher.c'  are 
located then run:

	make
	
NOTE: If there is any issues running the
program, run:

	make clean

then,

	make
	
Lastly, run the module install script
provided with:

	./install_module.sh
	
Or, 
if you perfer to add the module yourself:

	insmod sys_xcrypt
	
========= Usage ========= 

./xcipher [OPTIONS] [-p PASSWORD] <infile> <outfile>

Options are as follows:
   -p [PASS] :  Use [PASS] as password (skip prompt)
   -d        :  Decrypt <infile> to <outfile>
   -e        :  Encrypt <infile> to <outfile>
   -h        :  Show help screen
